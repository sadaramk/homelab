### 🕧 Background

I've made the decision to repurpose my old Mac mini as a new homelab. Over time, I've discovered an effective method of seamlessly transitioning between my Macs without wasting precious time on reinstalling the necessary tools required for my day job using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/)

My ultimate goal with this homelab project is to replicate the seamless experience I have achieved on my Macs. In doing so, I aim to maintain a public repository where I can openly share my newfound knowledge and document any mistakes I make along the way. By embracing this transparent approach, I hope to foster continuous learning and personal growth.




### ⌛ Roadmap

- [x] Setup a new github repository. [Repo](https://github.com//sadaramk/homelab)
- [ ] Develop or utilize existing framework to generate README.MD
- [ ] Document Project Structure




### 📝 Pre-Requisites

This project was setup with 2 configuration modes in mind Ⓜ️
  - Development Mode - I won't always be working on my homelab Mac, so the tools required for running the homelab may not necessarily be the same as those I need for development. [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/) provide a straightforward solution, allowing me to run this project on any machine 😁
  - HomeLab - Set of tools required to run my homelab

### Development Mode
  - Visual Studio Code [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - VSC Extensions
    - [Remove Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)

### Homelab
  - Install [go-task](https://taskfile.dev/)
  ```
  brew install go-task
  ```
