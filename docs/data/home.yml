      I've made the decision to repurpose my old Mac mini as a new homelab. Over time, I've discovered an effective method of seamlessly transitioning between my Macs without wasting precious time on reinstalling the necessary tools required for my day job using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/)

      My ultimate goal with this homelab project is to replicate the seamless experience I have achieved on my Macs. In doing so, I aim to maintain a public repository where I can openly share my newfound knowledge and document any mistakes I make along the way. By embracing this transparent approach, I hope to foster continuous learning and personal growth.
  - Title: ‚åõ Roadmap
    Content: |
      - [x] Setup a new github repository. [Repo](https://github.com//sadaramk/homelab)
      - [ ] Develop or utilize existing framework to generate README.MD
      - [ ] Document Project Structure
  - Title: üìù Pre-Requisites
    Content: |
      This project was setup with 2 configuration modes in mind ‚ìÇÔ∏è
        - Development Mode - I won't always be working on my homelab Mac, so the tools required for running the homelab may not necessarily be the same as those I need for development. [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/) provide a straightforward solution, allowing me to run this project on any machine üòÅ
        - HomeLab - Set of tools required to run my homelab

      ### Development Mode
        - Visual Studio Code [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
        - VSC Extensions
          - [Remove Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)

      ### Homelab
        - Step 1 - Install [go-task](https://taskfile.dev/)
        ```
        brew install go-task

        # List Available Tasks
        task -l
        ```
        - Step 2 - Install Pre-Requisites on the Mac
        ```
        # Run initial Task to install pre-requisites
        task mac:init
         ```
