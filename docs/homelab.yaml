description: 'Revamping my Mac Mini into a Homelab:' Streamlined Transitions and Continuous Learning :construction:

background:  |-

I've made the decision to repurpose my old Mac mini as a new homelab. Over time, I've discovered an effective method of seamlessly transitioning between my Macs without wasting precious time on reinstalling the necessary tools required for my day job using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/)

My ultimate goal with this homelab project is to replicate the seamless experience I have achieved on my Macs. In doing so, I aim to maintain a public repository where I can openly share my newfound knowledge and document any mistakes I make along the way. By embracing this transparent approach, I hope to foster continuous learning and personal growth.
